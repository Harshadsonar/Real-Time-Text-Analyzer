There are two buttons by which we can switch between word Input component and Paragraph Component.

I've build a Real-time Text Analyzer that calculates the following metrics in real-time as the user types a word: 
1. Characters
2. Words 

After clicking on Process Word Button it calls the API and sends us the data such as
1. Definition
2. Parts of speech
3. Synonyms
4. Antonyms

It calculates the following metrics in real-time as the user types a paragraph: 
1. Number of Characters 
2. Number of Words 
3. Number of Sentences 
4. Number of Paragraphs 
5. Number of Spaces 
6. Number of Punctuations 

calculations are dynamic and update in real-time as the user modifies the input text. 

Used keyframes, linear-gradient and hover effects to make project.
