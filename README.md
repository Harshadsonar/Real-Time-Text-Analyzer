I've build a Real-time Text Analyzer that calculates the following metrics in real-time as the user types a paragraph: 
1. Number of Characters 
2. Number of Words 
3. Number of Sentences 
4. Number of Paragraphs 
5. Number of Spaces 
6. Number of Punctuations 

calculations are dynamic and update in real-time as the user modifies the input text.
